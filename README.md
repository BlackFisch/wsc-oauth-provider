# wsc-oauth-provider

## About
This is a fork of the [OAuth Provider Plugin by EQDKPlus](https://wsc.eqdkp-plus.eu/Extensionlist/Oauth-provider-p9.html).

This addon for the [Woltlab Community Suite (WSC)](https://www.woltlab.com/) aims to provide a OAuth2 Provider for use with external services. For an explanation of how to use and implement this, see Documentation below.

The main goal of this fork is to make the plugin 
1. Accessible to everyone free of charge
2. Make it available for WSC 3.0 as well

## Documentation
Since this is a fork with not much changed at all, please refer to [EQDKPlus' Documentation](https://wsc-docs.eqdkp-plus.eu/oauthprovider_index.html) over on their page.

## Packing the Plugin
For a quick guide on how to pack the plugin yourself, please refer to the [Tutorial "Creating a simple package"](https://docs.woltlab.com/getting-started_quick-start.html) over at WoltLabs documentation. If you have any problems, feel free to [create a new Issue](https://github.com/BlackFisch/wsc-oauth-provider/issues/new).

## Issues & Contribution
If you manage to find an issue - congratulations first of all! :tada:

You can of course simply [create a new Issue](https://github.com/BlackFisch/wsc-oauth-provider/issues/new) here on GitHub and I'll try my best at fixing it, even though I'm definitely not a pro in PHP myself. That being said, feel free to fork the repo and [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/BlackFisch/wsc-oauth-provider/compare) - every help is appreciated!
