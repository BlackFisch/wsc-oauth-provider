# wsc-oauth-provider

## About
This is a fork of the [OAuth Provider Plugin by EQDKPlus](https://wsc.eqdkp-plus.eu/Extensionlist/Oauth-provider-p9.html).

This addon for the [Woltlab Community Suite (WSC)](https://www.woltlab.com/) aims to provide a OAuth2 Provider for use with external services. For an explanation of how to use and implement this, see [Documentation].

The main goal of this fork is to make the plugin 
1. Accessible to everyone free of charge
2. Make it available for WSC 3.0 as well

## Documentation
Since this is a fork with not much changed at all, please refer to [EQDKPlus' Documentation](https://wsc-docs.eqdkp-plus.eu/oauthprovider_index.html) over on their page.

## Issues & Contribution
If you manage to find an issue - congratulations first of all!
You can of course simply [create a new Issue](https://github.com/BlackFisch/wsc-oauth-provider/issues/new) here on GitHub and I'll try my best at fixing it, even though I'm definitely not a pro in PHP myself. That being said, feel free to fork the repo and [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/BlackFisch/wsc-oauth-provider/compare) - every help is appreciated!
